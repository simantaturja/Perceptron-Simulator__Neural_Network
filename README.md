# Perceptron

# Introduction
A quick and easy implementation of a simple single layer perceptron. I built it from the scratch in Python, numpy is not even used in the implementation. Feel free to use this as a simple single layer perceptron library. Python's 2D Graphing Library 'Matplotlib' is used for plotting and animation.

# Installation
1. To install matplotlib type in the terminal: 'pip install matplotlib'
2. Run the main.py file.
